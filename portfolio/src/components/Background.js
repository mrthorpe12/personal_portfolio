            <h1>My Background</h1>
            <p>As a graduate of the University of Wisconsin-Madison (B.S. Russian Language and Literature, 2021) with an extensive background in geographic information systems (GIS), I can appreciate the need in today’s workforce for individuals who can bring many different skillsets to the table. My humanities background, combined with my technical expertise, allow me to approach challenges from an unorthodox angle and propose solutions accordingly.</p>
            <p>Through my work with the University of Wisconsin’s Traffic Operations and Safety Laboratory, I gained substantial experience working with Java and JavaScript within an Apache Struts environment. My recent internships with the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI) and Socket Telecom have allowed me to hone my software development skills and have also exposed me to the basics of data science.</p>
            <p>I am currently pursuing a M.S. in Information Science (expected completion May 2023), after which I hope to find employment in a software engineering and/or data science-related role.</p>
