            <h1>My Background</h1>
            <p>As a graduate of the University of Wisconsin-Madison (B.S. Russian Language and Literature, 2021) with an extensive background in geographic information systems (GIS), I can appreciate the need in today’s workforce for individuals who can bring many different skillsets to the table. My humanities background, combined with my technical expertise, allow me to approach challenges from an unorthodox angle and propose solutions accordingly.</p>
            <p>Through my work with the University of Wisconsin’s Traffic Operations and Safety Laboratory, I gained substantial experience working with Java and JavaScript within an Apache Struts environment. In my current job, I work with Python, XML, and JavaScript to manage traffic crash datasets and produce front-end products that are easy to understand.</p>
            <p>I am currently pursuing a M.S. in Information Science (expected completion May 2023), after which I hope to find employment in a job that will allow me to make the most of my foreign language skills and my experience working with software.</p>
