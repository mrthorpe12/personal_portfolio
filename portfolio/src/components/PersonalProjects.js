            <p>As part of my first semester coursework at UMSI, I worked as part of a student-led team to help EcoWorks, a local non-profit, improve their organizational process.  Founded in 1981, EcoWorks is dedicated to helping low-income homeowners in Metro Detroit make their homes more energy-efficient.  Our team interviewed the organization's employees, as well as homeowners who had been helped by EcoWorks, and succeeded in putting together a plan for how EcoWorks could more efficiently manage their operations.</p>
