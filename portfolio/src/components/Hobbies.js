            <h1>Hobbies</h1>
            <p><strong>"I don't have hobbies; hobbies cost money. Interests are quite free."</strong> - George Carlin</p>
            <h2>Travel</h2>
            <p>I've visited most of the contiguous U.S. and have been to Spain, France, Italy, and the UK. At some
                point in the near future, I'd like to travel to Russia, since I studied Russian as an undergrad!
            </p>
            <p>Favorite state: Montana. Reason: I enjoy the outdoors, and Montana has a lot of outdoors to offer.
                Highly recommend Glacier National Park if you're interested in hiking, fishing, camping, or winter
                sports!</p>
            <p>Favorite city: Sevilla, Spain. Reason: Fascinating culture and awesome people. Sevilla is a great
                place to
                experience Spanish culture firsthand, and the area's history is amazing.</p>
            <h2>Music</h2>
            <p>Played the string bass throughout middle and high school. Was chosen to attend the Missouri
                All-State
                Orchestra twice (2015 and 2016).</p>
            <h2>Sports</h2>
            <p>Football: Diehard Packers fan (my family is originally from Wisconsin).</p>
            <p>Baseball: Enjoy watching the St. Louis Cardinals.</p>
            <p>Started practicing Brazilian jiu-jitsu this summer. Really enjoy it as a sport and would recommend
                it to anyone who's interested!</p>
